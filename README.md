## Usage
Download the project files and run `main.py` 
You will be prompted with 2 questions the first one being the amounts of codes to check, usally the more the better but this is up to you the seconds prompt will ask you for a discord webhook url this is not needed as such but if your running it on a server this is a very good idea

## Installation
The only requement that is currently needed is `discord_webhook` that can be installed using `python3 -m pip install discord_webhook` on linux and on windows it is `py -3 -m pip install discord_webhook`
