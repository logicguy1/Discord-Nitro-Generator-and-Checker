## About The Project

<img src="assets/example.png" alt="Image of product">

It generates and checks discord nitro codes at the same time for maximum efficiency

### Built With

* [Requests](https://github.com/psf/requests)
* [Discord webhook](https://github.com/lovvskillz/python-discord-webhook)
* [Colored](https://gitlab.com/dslackw/colored)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
You need to install Python, that can be done [here](https://www.python.org)

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/logicguy1/Discord-Nitro-Generator-and-Checker.git
   ```
2. Install Python packages
   ```sh
   # Windows:
   py -3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Unix
   python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
#### Or this can be done using android with unrooted Termux
```
git clone https://github.com/logicguy1/Discord-Nitro-Generator-and-Checker
pkg install python
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd Discord-Nitro-Generator-and-Checker
python3 main.py
```
   
## Usage

Run the `main.py` file using `py -3 main.py` 
The code will show you two prompts:
1. How many codes to generate 
2. If you want to use a discord webhook, if you dont know how to get a discord webhook url it is located at   
   ```channel settings » intergrations » webhooks » create webhook```  
   If you dont want to use a webhook simply leave this blank  

The code will start generating and checking after that step

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_
